         <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML creates the structure of a website.</li>
            <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage i.e. text, images, headers, and lists.</li>
            <li>Most HTML elements start with an opening tag and end with a closing tag represented with angle brackets.</li>
            <li>The head element contains information, metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. This metadata contains data about the webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve the webpage to users. This contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
            <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user on the webpage.</li>
            <li>The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration tells the browser it should expect HTML on the page.</li>
            <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
            <li>The title element defines the title of a webpage, which is important for Search Engine Optemization, or SEO.</li>
            <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
            <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document, such as an external CSS style sheet.</li>
            <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. This makes the HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. Additionally, semantic HTML makes the webpage accessible to those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
            <li>Section elements organize a webpage into sections by thematic content, such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.</li>
            <li>The div element creates a division on the page.</li>
            <li>The span element creates an inline division on the page.</li>
            <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. The lower the number, the larger and more prominent the heading.</li>
            <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
            <li>Th ul element creates an unordered list, the ol element creates an ordered list, and the li element creates a list item.</li>
            <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
            <li>The scr attribute defines the location of the image.</li>
            <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
            <li>The anchor element creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
            <li>The href attribute points to the URL of the link.</li>
          </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS adds style to the webpage. It defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. We can use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide ranfe of style options.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML tag using the style attribute with a CSS style rule. This is for internal styling, within the HTML document.</li>
          <li>An external style sheet, which allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, making the design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain the CSS property we want to apply to the element and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>We can think about each HTML element as a box. The CSS box model refers to the margins outside the element and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>To apply a rule to all elements visible on the page, we use an asterisk.</li>
          <li>We can apply CSS rules to certain elements as well by using a comma between the two elements. We can center an element on a webpage by using the text-align property and applying the value of center.</li>
          <li>The display property with the value of block assigns an element to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>To link the external style sheet to the HTML document, we use the link element with the rel and href attributes. The rel attribute is assigned “stylesheet” and the href attribute is assigned the location of the style sheet within our folder.</li>
          <li>We can use class attributes as selectors which allows us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. The class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose with elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>We can use the card class selector, which applies the CSS rules for any HTML element with the class of card. We put a period preceding card, which designates this as a class selector.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project. It helps us track changes locally on our computer.</li>
          <li>Git is accessed through the command line. These commands always start with git.</li>
          <li>Feature branches are where we add any new code.</li>
          <li>The default branch is called main, or sometimes master. No new code should be added to this branch.</li>
          <li>Once the changes from the feature branch are approved, they are merged into the main branch.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds all changes to code. This command tells Git that the changes will be added in the next commit.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "message": stages the files to be committed. Once committed, the feature branch will be updated with the new code.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: makes sure that we are working on up to date code. This makes sure our local branch is in sync with the main branch in GitHub.</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: pushes the changes to the remote branch.</li>
